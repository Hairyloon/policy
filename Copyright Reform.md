The Pirate Party UK is committed to reshaping copyright policies to address the challenges and opportunities of the digital age. Our comprehensive approach to copyright reform seeks to strike a balance between protecting creators' rights and fostering a vibrant creative landscape while ensuring the public's access to knowledge and culture. We believe that copyright should adapt to the modern world, empowering individuals, promoting innovation, and supporting educational and artistic endeavors. By advocating for necessary changes, voluntary collective licensing, and user representation, we aim to create a copyright framework that is fair, flexible, and reflective of the values of the digital era.

**Must-Have (M):**
1. **Digital Preservation:** Implement policies that allow cultural institutions such as libraries, museums, and archives to preserve and provide access to digital content, ensuring the long-term availability of important works for research and educational purposes.[^1]

2. **Voluntary Collective Licensing:** Encourage the development of voluntary collective licensing schemes that simplify the process of obtaining licenses for the use of copyrighted works, benefiting both users and creators.[^1]

3. **Educational Use Exemption:** Establish clear exemptions for the use of copyrighted material in educational settings, enabling educators and students to utilize copyrighted works for educational purposes without fear of legal repercussions.[^1]

4. **User Representation in Copyright Policy:** Promote the inclusion of user representatives and public interest advocates in copyright policy-making processes, ensuring a balanced and inclusive approach to copyright reform.[^1]

**Should-Have (S):**
1. **Open Access to Research:** Support policies that promote open access to publicly-funded research, making scientific and academic publications freely available to the public, which can accelerate innovation and knowledge dissemination.[^2]

2. **Interoperability Requirements:** Advocate for regulations that require digital platforms and devices to be interoperable, allowing users to access and transfer content between different platforms without restrictions.[^2]

3. **Small Business Exemptions:** Consider exemptions or reduced copyright restrictions for small businesses and startups to foster innovation and competition in the creative industry.[^2]

4. **Fair Use Guidelines:** Develop clear and comprehensive fair use guidelines to provide guidance to content creators, users, and courts in determining what constitutes fair use, promoting legal certainty and avoiding unnecessary litigation.[^2]

**Could-Have (C):**
1. **Limitation on Contractual Override:** Ensure that copyright limitations and exceptions cannot be overridden by contractual agreements, safeguarding users' rights even when dealing with private entities.[^3]

2. **Artistic Freedom Protection:** Explore measures to protect the artistic freedom of creators, allowing them to express their ideas without undue censorship or restrictions.[^3]

3. **Fair Compensation for Artists:** Consider mechanisms to ensure that artists receive fair compensation for their work while balancing the interests of users and the public.[^3]

**Wish-to-Have:**
1. **Public Domain Expansion:** Advocate for policies that expand the public domain, making more works available for unrestricted use by the public.[^4]

2. **Orphan Works Reforms:** Support reforms that simplify the process of using orphan works (works whose copyright owners are difficult or impossible to identify or locate), allowing for their use under certain circumstances.[^4]

3. **Creative Commons Integration:** Promote the integration and recognition of Creative Commons licenses as valid alternatives to traditional copyright, fostering more flexible and permissive use of creative works.[^4]

4. **International Cooperation and Rejoining the EU:** Advocate for international cooperation on copyright reform, including potentially rejoining the EU to influence copyright policies at a broader level[^9].

5. **Digital First Sale Doctrine:** Introduce a digital-first sale doctrine that allows users to resell digital content they have purchased, promoting consumer rights in the digital era[^12].

6. **Reduced Copyright Terms:** Advocate for reducing the excessive length of copyright terms to strike a better balance between creators' interests and the public's access to culture and knowledge[^13].

7. **Expanded Access to Educational Materials:** Work towards expanding access to educational and research materials, allowing students and researchers greater use of copyrighted works for non-commercial purposes[^14].

**Footnotes:**
[^1]: The biggest issue with the underlying treaty is that it has remained virtually unchanged since 1986, and while there have been some updates, it is no longer suitable for the modern world. The Berne Convention serves as the foundation for all other treaties related to copyright, but the problem lies in enforcement. Some countries, like China, have signed the convention but tend to ignore its provisions, creating an uneven playing field and leading to situations like the rise of Shenzhen. Furthermore, the Berne Convention is required by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to allow for equal trade with other countries, even without specific trade deals.

[^2]: TRIPS introduced regulations that prevent the sale of products that break DRM (digital rights management) and make unauthorized use of copyrighted works illegal. It also introduced safe harbors for websites, allowing for the takedown of copyrighted materials from online platforms.

[^3]: Artificial Scarcity & Anti-Monopoly: Critics argue that copyright creates artificial scarcity and potential monopolies, limiting others from using ideas expressed in copyrighted works and stifling fair competition and innovation. Historical Comparison: Some compare copyright to historical practices of sharing knowledge, questioning the shift to stricter intellectual property rights. Fan Projects: Copyright restrictions can hinder fan creations and derivative works, limiting creativity within creative communities. Freedom of Knowledge: Advocates for open access believe copyright hinders the free flow of information and progress. Authorship and Creativity: Proponents of copyright support compensation for creators to encourage continued creativity. Preservation of Cultural Works: Restrictive copyright practices may impede efforts to archive and preserve cultural works. On the other side, some argue for the importance of copyright in protecting creators' rights and ensuring control over their work.

[^4]: Additional issues to consider for the Pirate Party UK's copyright reform policy include addressing artificial scarcity and anti-monopoly concerns, historical comparisons of copyright practices, how copyright restrictions impact fan projects and freedom of knowledge, and balancing authorship and creativity with the preservation of cultural works. Effective communication and engagement with the public will also play a vital role in shaping and advocating for these policies.
