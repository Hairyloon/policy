# Expanding Access to Comprehensive Care for Trans and Non-Binary Individuals

## Legal Identity Change (Self-ID):
- The Pirate Party supports the inclusion of a legal identity change process that allows individuals to self-identify their gender.
- The process should be accessible, streamlined, and respectful of an individual's self-determined gender identity.
- Removing unnecessary bureaucratic barriers and ensuring privacy and confidentiality are essential aspects of this policy.

## Non-Binary/Third Gender Option:
- The Pirate Party recognizes the importance of acknowledging and respecting non-binary and third gender identities.
- Proposes the implementation of a voluntary opt-in system that allows individuals to choose a non-binary or third gender option on official identification documents.
- This option should be available to those who wish to express their gender identity outside the traditional binary framework.

## Empowering General Practitioners (GPs):
- GPs should be equipped and encouraged to provide a wider range of care for trans and non-binary individuals, provided they have received appropriate training.
- GPs should be able to offer ongoing monitoring, adjustment of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) dosages, and related medical care within their scope of practice.

## Eliminating Dependence on Gender Identity Clinics (GICs):
- Proposes that GPs be granted the authority to provide comprehensive care for trans and non-binary individuals, reducing reliance on GICs for routine medical management.

## Blood Tests and Medical Care:
- GPs should have the authority to order blood tests and other medical care for trans and non-binary individuals, including tests that may be considered "dual use" but are necessary for proper diagnosis and management of various health concerns.
- The current restrictions on ordering such tests should be lifted, allowing trans and non-binary individuals to access the same level of medical care as cisgender patients.

## Specialized Training and Collaboration:
- Specialized training should be made available for healthcare professionals, including GPs and mental health practitioners, to ensure they have the necessary expertise in trans and non-binary healthcare.
- GPs should be able to refer patients to local mental health caregivers who have appropriate specialist training, rather than being limited to the confines of a GIC.
