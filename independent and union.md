## Policy Statement: Self-Determination and Cooperation within the UK

At the heart of the Pirate Party UK (PPUK) is the belief in democratic principles, self-determination, and collaboration. As such, we recognize the diverse range of opinions on the matter of England, Scottish and Welsh independence within the United Kingdom. Our policy seeks to balance the right to self-determination with the benefits of unity and cooperation.

### Must-Have

1. **Right to Self-Determination**: PPUK acknowledges the historical context and complex emotions associated with the history of colonization and mistreatment. We believe that the people of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should have the right to determine their political future through democratic processes.

2. **Democratic Mechanism for Independence**: PPUK supports the implementation of a fair and democratic mechanism that allows nations within the UK, including England, Scotland, Wales, and Gibraltar, to pursue independence if their citizens express a clear desire to do so. This mechanism should ensure transparency, inclusivity, and adherence to democratic principles.

### Should-Have

3. **Unity and Cooperation**: While respecting the right to self-determination, PPUK also recognizes the value of collaboration and unity among the nations of the United Kingdom. Working together, sharing resources, and addressing common challenges can lead to stronger outcomes for all involved parties.

5. **Equitable Power Dynamics**: PPUK emphasizes the importance of maintaining equitable power dynamics within the UK. We aim to create a structure where decisions are made collaboratively, and all nations have a say in matters that affect them, thus avoiding undue dominance of any single nation over the others.

### Could-Have

6. **Financial Incentives for Transition**: PPUK recognizes the potential financial implications of independence. To facilitate a smooth transition, we propose exploring mechanisms such as providing financial support or "refund" for a specified period following independence to support economic stability during the transition phase.

7. **Shared Governance Framework**: PPUK advocates for establishing a shared governance framework that allows for greater representation of all nations within the UK. This framework should provide a platform for open discussions and decision-making on matters of mutual interest, fostering a sense of belonging and participation.

8. **Mutual Benefits of Unity**: PPUK believes in highlighting the mutual benefits of unity among the nations of the UK. Emphasize the advantages of a united approach in addressing global challenges, leveraging collective resources, and maximizing economic growth and prosperity opportunities.

9. **Devolution of Power**: PPUK encourages the continued devolution of power to regional governments within the UK. This ensures that decisions are made at the most appropriate level and that citizens have a direct say in matters that affect their daily lives, thereby reinforcing the democratic principles that underpin the UK's governance structure.

10. **Open Dialogue and Engagement**: PPUK supports ongoing open dialogues and engagement with citizens across all nations. Highlight the importance of involving the public in discussions about the UK's future, allowing their voices to be heard and considered in the decision-making process.

11. **Inclusivity and Representation**: PPUK believes in promoting inclusivity and representation in all aspects of governance. Please make sure that diverse voices are heard and accounted for in decision-making processes.

### Like Have

4. **Addressing Historical Injustices**: PPUK acknowledges the history of cultural suppression and mistreatment experienced by various nations within the UK. While we recognize the importance of addressing historical injustices, we acknowledge that directly implementing this aspect is outside the scope of this policy.

12. **Cultural Exchange and Collaboration**: PPUK supports promoting cultural exchange and collaboration among all nations within the UK. Highlight the richness and diversity that different cultures bring to the collective identity of the UK, and showcase how these cultural exchanges can lead to a stronger sense of unity while celebrating unique heritage.

13. **Stronger Together in International Affairs**: PPUK underscores the importance of presenting a united front internationally. Emphasize how a cohesive UK can have a more influential voice in global negotiations, treaties, and alliances, ultimately benefiting all nations within the UK by preserving their interests and sovereignty.

14. **Inclusive National Identity**: PPUK seeks to foster an inclusive national identity that celebrates the UK's shared values and its constituent nations' unique identities. Promote that staying within the UK allows nations to contribute to and shape this inclusive identity while maintaining their cultural heritage.

15. **Resource Sharing for Common Goals**: PPUK believes in the potential for resource sharing among nations to achieve common goals, such as infrastructure development, healthcare advancements, and environmental sustainability. This cooperation can lead to more effective solutions that benefit all citizens.

16. **Inclusivity and Representation**: In the event of an independence referendum, we advocate for comprehensive and unbiased information campaigns that present the pros and cons of different outcomes. The electorate should be empowered with accurate information to make an informed decision.

17. **Dynamic Constitutional Review**: PPUK proposes a dynamic constitutional review process that adapts to changing circumstances. This review mechanism ensures that the rights, responsibilities, and relationships among the nations within the UK remain relevant and responsive to evolving needs and aspirations.

PPUK acknowledges that this policy is subject to further discussion, research, and consultation with our members and relevant stakeholders. We remain committed to fostering a fair and inclusive dialogue on Scottish and Welsh independence within the United Kingdom.
