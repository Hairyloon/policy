# Pirate Party UK Policy on Cannabis Decriminalization and Possession for Recreational Use

## Cannabis for Medical Use

The Pirate Party UK acknowledges the potential medical benefits of cannabis for certain conditions and believes that patients should have access to it when prescribed by a qualified healthcare professional. Our policy supports:

- The full legalization of cannabis for medical use, subject to rigorous quality control and regulation.

- Cannabis should be available on prescription where there is a demonstrable medical value in providing it. Prescription cannabis should not be inhaled/smoked unless there is a clear medical need for it to be in that particular form. However, inhalers and sprays that deliver cannabis in a controlled manner without combustion or vaping are exceptions to this rule and may be prescribed when deemed appropriate by medical professionals.

- Ensuring that patients have affordable access to medical cannabis through the NHS, reducing the financial burden on patients with qualifying medical conditions. However, we recognize that the availability of cannabis in the NHS depends on internal NHS factors, including supply chain and availability.


## Recreational Use: Decriminalization and Personal Possession

The Pirate Party UK advocates for the decriminalization of cannabis possession for recreational use by adults. We support:

- Treating possession of cannabis products, including both the plant material and its THC content, as a civil offense rather than a criminal one for personal use by adults, with a possession limit set at 30 grams.

- Decriminalizing the possession of up to 30 grams of cannabis, which includes both the weight of the plant material and the THC content, for personal use by adults.

- Redirecting law enforcement resources towards tackling more serious crimes and addressing the root causes of drug addiction.

## Non-Inhaled Aerosol Products Forms of Cannabis

The Pirate Party UK believes that the ban on cannabis in non-inhaled aerosol products forms should be lifted. We support:

- The legalization of cannabis in non-inhaled aerosol products forms such as oils, tinctures, capsules, edibles, and vaping products.

- Regulation and labeling requirements to ensure the safety and quality of non-inhaled aerosol cannabis products, including testing for potency and contaminants, child-resistant packaging, and clear labeling of THC content.

- Responsible consumption education and harm reduction measures to minimize potential risks associated with non-inhaled aerosol cannabis use.

## Regulation and Safety

The Pirate Party UK advocates for a well-regulated cannabis market to:

- Ensure that cannabis products meet safety and quality standards.

- Implement taxation on cannabis sales to generate revenue for public services and drug education and rehabilitation programs.

- Monitor and enforce regulations to prevent illegal distribution and sales of cannabis.

## Cannabis Shops

The Pirate Party UK recognizes the importance of establishing regulated cannabis shops as a crucial component of a responsible and controlled cannabis market. We believe that the creation of legal cannabis retail establishments is essential to achieving our goals of decriminalization, safety, and revenue generation. Here are our key points regarding cannabis shops:

- **Licensing and Regulation:** We support a licensing system for cannabis shops, similar to that of alcohol retailers, to ensure that they operate within established legal and safety standards. These standards should include age restrictions for customers, strict inventory control, and employee training.

- **Local Control:** Local communities should have a say in the establishment and operation of cannabis shops within their jurisdictions. We encourage local governments to determine the number, location, and operating hours of these establishments based on the preferences and needs of their communities.

- **Product Variety:** Cannabis shops should offer a variety of cannabis products, including different strains, edibles, oils, and non-inhaled aerosol products. This variety not only caters to consumer preferences but also provides alternatives to smoking, promoting harm reduction.

- **Security Measures:** Security measures should be in place to ensure the safety of both customers and employees. This includes surveillance systems, secure storage of products, and adequate security personnel.

- **Taxation and Revenue:** Cannabis shops should be subject to taxation, and the revenue generated should be reinvested into public services, education, and drug rehabilitation programs. This revenue can play a vital role in addressing societal needs while reducing the burden on taxpayers.

- **Consumer Education:** Cannabis shops should have a role in providing consumer education on responsible cannabis use. They should disseminate information on dosage, potential risks, and the importance of not driving under the influence of cannabis.

- **Access for Medical Users:** Medical cannabis users should have convenient access to cannabis products through licensed shops, ensuring that they can obtain their medication safely and reliably.

## Personal Cultivation Limits and the Right to Grow Your Own

The Pirate Party UK supports the fundamental right of individuals to grow their own cannabis plants for personal use. We believe that personal cultivation can not only ensure the quality of the product but also reduce the influence of the black market and criminal organizations. To accommodate variations in cultivation practices and plant sizes, we propose the following guidelines:

Adults aged 18 and over should be allowed to cultivate cannabis for personal use. The total amount of pure plant material weight, including dried cannabis flower, leaves, and any other plant parts, should not exceed an initial limit of X grams, with the potential for adjustments based on expert recommendations and evolving cultivation practices. This limit aims to strike a balance between personal freedom and public safety.

Cultivation should be limited to private, enclosed spaces to ensure that it does not become a public nuisance or safety hazard.

Individuals cultivating cannabis should take measures to prevent unauthorized access, especially by minors, and should not engage in excessive production beyond personal consumption.


## Research and Education

We support efforts to:

- Promote scientific research into the medical benefits and potential risks of cannabis.

- Educate the public, healthcare professionals, and patients about the responsible use of cannabis.

- Implement public health campaigns to raise awareness about the potential risks associated with cannabis use, especially among vulnerable populations.

## Conclusion

The Pirate Party UK's policy on cannabis decriminalization and possession for recreational use aims to strike a balance between addressing the legal status of cannabis for non-medical use, ensuring responsible use, and prioritizing public health and safety. We advocate for a comprehensive approach that combines decriminalization, regulation, taxation, education, and medical use legalization to address the complexities of cannabis policy in the UK.
