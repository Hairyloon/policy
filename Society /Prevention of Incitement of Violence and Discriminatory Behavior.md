# Prevention of Incitement of Violence and Discriminatory Behavior

## Preamble
The Pirate Party UK recognizes the critical importance of preventing the incitement of violence and discriminatory behavior, as well as upholding the principles of equality and non-discrimination. In this spirit, we propose an amendment to the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, the Equality Act, and the Football Offences Act to include "adoption," "abortion," "immigration status," and "refugee status" as protected characteristics.

## Proposed Amendments

### 1. Amendment to the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006
- Add a new section to the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 to include "adoption," "abortion," "immigration status," and "refugee status" as protected characteristics alongside existing characteristics such as race and religion.
- Specify that individuals shall be protected from threats or incitement of violence and hatred based on these additional characteristics.
- Clarify that the Act applies to situations involving adoption, abortion, immigration status, and refugee status.

### 2. Amendment to the Equality Act
- Amend the Equality Act to incorporate "adoption," "abortion," "immigration status," and "refugee status" as protected characteristics in line with other characteristics already protected.
- Ensure that these characteristics are included in all relevant sections of the Act where protected characteristics are mentioned.
- Make it explicit that discrimination, harassment, and victimization based on these characteristics are prohibited and unlawful.

### 3. Amendment to the Football Offences Act
- Include "adoption," "abortion," "immigration status," and "refugee status" as protected characteristics in the Football Offences Act alongside existing protected characteristics.
- Prohibit incitement of violence, discriminatory behavior, and hate speech based on these newly included characteristics at designated football matches, in line with the Act's objective to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment during sporting events.

## Rationale
- Inclusion of these additional protected characteristics in all three Acts is essential for preventing the incitement of violence and discrimination, promoting the values of equality, fairness, and human rights.
- "Adoption" is included to prevent discrimination against adoptive parents and their children.
- "Abortion" is included to safeguard the rights and dignity of individuals making reproductive choices.
- "Immigration status" and "refugee status" are included to protect immigrants and refugees from discrimination, promoting their integration and well-being in society.

## Implementation
- The proposed amendments shall be introduced and debated within the UK legislative process.
- The Pirate Party UK shall actively advocate for these changes through political channels, seeking support from like-minded parties and organizations.
- Engage with experts and stakeholders to ensure the legal and practical viability of these amendments.

## Conclusion
By amending the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, the Equality Act, and the Football Offences Act to include "adoption," "abortion," "immigration status," and "refugee status" as protected characteristics, we demonstrate our commitment to preventing incitement of violence, discrimination, and the promotion of a more inclusive and just society. This proposal aims to uphold the values of equality, fairness, and human rights.
