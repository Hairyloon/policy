Many people argue that Britain needs a written constitution, because of all the things that are going wrong. 
However, most of the things that they complain of are due to abuses of the public's trust, which is already a criminal offence, albeit one that is almost never enforced.
For those who use Twitter, there is quite a good study of the Met's failure to address the prime minister's misconduct around #PartyGate here: https://twitter.com/Hairyloon/status/1712388208892239934

The simplest and most far reaching step that anybody could do to restore trust in democracy is to start prosecuting these acts of misconduct, and to not stop until that trust is fully restored.
