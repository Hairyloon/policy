Conflicts Of Interest
=====================

Some politicians may vote in favour of policies that benefit themselves 
financially. MPs would be banned from voting when they have a financial 
interest in the result 

This is already against parliamentary rules: https://t.co/QFHGum7spM
  "2. Members must base their conduct on a consideration of the public interest, avoid
  conflict between personal interest and the public interest and resolve any conflict between
  the two, at once, and in favour of the public interest."

What is needed is a better mechanism of enforcement.
