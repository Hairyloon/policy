## Expanding Access to Comprehensive Care for Trans Individuals

1. Legal Identity Change (Self-ID): The Pirate Party supports including a legal identity change process that allows individuals to self-identify their gender. This process should be accessible, streamlined, and respectful of an individual's self-determined gender identity. Removing unnecessary bureaucratic barriers and ensuring privacy and confidentiality are essential aspects of this policy.

2. Non-Binary/Third Gender Option: The Pirate Party acknowledges and respects non-binary and third-gender identities. We propose implementing a voluntary opt-in system that allows individuals to choose a non-binary or third-gender option on official identification documents, such as passports, driver's licenses, and birth certificates. This option should be available to those who wish to express their gender identity outside the traditional binary framework.

3. Recognizing the need for comprehensive healthcare for trans individuals, the Pirate Party advocates for a policy that addresses the limitations and challenges currently faced within the NHS regarding trans care.

4. Empowering General Practitioners (GPs): GPs should be equipped and encouraged to provide a wider range of care for trans individuals, provided they have received appropriate training. GPs should be able to offer ongoing monitoring, adjustment of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) dosages, and related medical care within their scope of practice.

5. Eliminating Dependence on GICs: Acknowledging the extensive waiting lists at Gender Identity Clinics (GICs), the Pirate Party proposes that GPs be granted the authority to provide comprehensive care for trans individuals, reducing reliance on GICs for routine medical management.

6. Blood Tests and Medical Care: GPs should have the authority to order blood tests and other medical care for trans individuals, including tests that may be considered "dual use" but are necessary for proper diagnosis and management of various health concerns. The current restrictions on ordering such tests should be lifted, allowing trans individuals to access the same level of medical care as cisgender patients.

7. Specialised training should be made available, but GPs shouldn't be expected to act as a one-stop shop for everything (they are meant to be *general* practitioners, after all). But take the mental health aspect of trans care, for example. GPs should be able to refer patients to any local mental health carer who has appropriate specialist training, and that specialist training made available to mental health practitioners who request it, rather than having them sequestered inside a GIC.

8. Collaboration and Referral Network: To ensure comprehensive care, GPs should establish collaborative networks with specialists, including endocrinologists, mental health professionals, and surgeons with expertise in transgender healthcare. This network will provide a coordinated approach to care, ensuring that trans individuals receive timely and appropriate referrals when necessary.

9. Community Consultation: The Pirate Party emphasizes the importance of engaging with the trans community, advocacy groups, and healthcare professionals to develop and refine policies related to trans healthcare. Their insights and experiences should be considered in shaping policies to ensure the provision of equitable and person-centered care.

By implementing these policies, the Pirate Party aims to address the current gaps and limitations in trans healthcare within the NHS, ensuring that trans individuals have access to comprehensive and timely care from knowledgeable healthcare professionals.
