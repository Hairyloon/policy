# Local Policy Overview

Welcome to the local policy section of the Pirate Party's website. We believe in local autonomy, and each local group may have its own unique set of policies to address specific issues in their area. While this is a general overview of our core local policies, we encourage our local groups to tailor their policies to best serve their community's needs.
