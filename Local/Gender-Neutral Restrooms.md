## Gender-Neutral Restrooms

The Pirate Party UK recognizes the importance of providing safe and inclusive facilities for all members of our community, including transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. We believe in the following principles to promote the availability of gender-neutral restrooms at the local policy level:

- **Inclusive Facilities:** We support local policies that require or encourage public and private establishments, including government buildings, schools, and businesses, to offer gender-neutral restrooms in addition to traditional gender-segregated facilities.

- **Accessible Signage:** We advocate for clear and inclusive restroom signage that respects individuals' gender identities and expressions, including using symbols or text that reflect a commitment to inclusivity.

- **Privacy and Safety:** Gender-neutral restrooms should prioritize privacy and safety for all users, ensuring that they are well-maintained, adequately lit, and monitored to deter harassment and vandalism.

- **Education and Awareness:** Local authorities should provide educational resources and campaigns to inform the public about the importance of gender-neutral restrooms, dispelling misconceptions and fostering understanding and acceptance.

- **Community Feedback:** Engage with the local community, including transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, to gather input on the design and placement of gender-neutral restrooms.

- **Legal Protections:** Advocate for and enforce anti-discrimination laws at the local level that specifically protect individuals based on gender identity and expression, ensuring that transgender individuals are not unfairly treated or excluded.

- **Accessible Design Standards:** Develop local design standards that accommodate individuals with diverse needs, including those with disabilities or medical conditions that require specific restroom features.

- **Collaboration:** Collaborate with businesses, educational institutions, and public facilities to implement these policies, recognizing that a cooperative approach is essential to create widespread change.

- **Periodic Review:** Regularly review and update local policies to ensure that they remain effective and responsive to the evolving needs of the transgender and gender non-conforming community.

By supporting gender-neutral restrooms at the local policy level, the Pirate Party UK aims to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all residents, regardless of their gender identity or expression. We believe in respecting the rights and dignity of every individual within our community.
