# Strengthening Collaborative and Inclusive Governance for Economic Growth

## Introduction

The Pirate Party UK is committed to a holistic approach to governance that not only addresses economic growth but also promotes citizen participation, continuous assessment, and civic education. This policy proposal builds upon our previous points to include collaborative governance, monitoring and evaluation, information and education, and the creation of citizen assemblies.

## Devolution for Inclusive Economic Growth

### Expansion of Mayoral Authorities

We support the expansion of mayoral authorities to cover every functional economic area in England, emphasizing collaboration between local governments, citizen assemblies, and central government. This approach ensures a coordinated effort to tackle complex issues.

### Fiscal Devolution

Our vision for fiscal devolution includes mechanisms for continuous monitoring and evaluation to assess the impact of local tax policies. Adjustments will be made as necessary to achieve the intended outcomes.

### Mitigating Spatial Inequalities

We will engage in public awareness and civic education campaigns to inform citizens about the benefits of fiscal devolution. Civic education will be integrated into the national curriculum to empower citizens with the knowledge needed to actively participate in local governance.

## Building Local Capacity

### Capacity Investment

Collaboration is at the heart of our approach. We advocate for expanded investment in building local capacity, including citizen assemblies, as integral parts of the decision-making process.

### Office for Place

The proposed "Office for Place" will work in close coordination with citizen assemblies to ensure local expertise and public input are integral to the policy design and implementation.

## Simplified and Strategic Funding

### Rationalized Funding

Our funding strategy will be designed collaboratively by local governments, citizen assemblies, and central government. These funds will align with long-term local objectives and reflect the needs and priorities identified by citizens.

### Competitive vs. Specialized Funding

Citizen assemblies will play a key role in deciding the strategic balance between competitive and specialized funding. Their input will guide funding distribution according to local needs and capacity.

## Geographical Targeting for Economic Inclusion

### Distinguishing Goals

Collaborative governance models will ensure a clear distinction between regional economic development and town/neighbourhood revitalization. Citizen assemblies will be responsible for reviewing and recommending strategies in both areas.

### Economic Equalization

The active participation of citizen assemblies will ensure that policies are designed to reduce economic inequalities between labor market areas.

### Direct Funding

Citizen assemblies will also play a role in determining how levelling up funds are directly allocated to functional economic areas, based on their insights into local needs and opportunities.

## Ensuring Long-term Focus

### Independent Institutions

We advocate for independent institutions to be responsible for monitoring and evaluating policy outcomes. Citizen assemblies will provide input, ensuring a citizen-centered approach to governance.

### Cross-Party Representation

Our vision for independent institutions includes cross-party representation, ensuring a balanced and consensus-driven perspective.

## Collaborative Governance

### Collaborative Models

We strongly advocate for collaborative governance models that involve local governments, citizen assemblies, and central government working together to address complex issues. This will promote coordinated solutions to challenges that require a multi-pronged approach.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

### Continuous Assessment

We will establish mechanisms for continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure that policy changes are achieving their intended outcomes. Citizen assemblies will participate in the assessment process, providing valuable insights into the impact of policies on local communities.

## Information and Education

### Public Awareness and Civic Education

We will actively promote public awareness and civic education campaigns to inform citizens about the benefits of decentralized governance and active civic participation. Civic education will be a part of the national curriculum to ensure informed and engaged citizens.

## Citizen Assemblies

### Randomly Selected Assemblies

We support the creation of citizen assemblies composed of randomly selected citizens, akin to jury service. These assemblies will play a crucial role in the decision-making process by discussing and making recommendations on various policy matters and public issues. Citizen assemblies will serve as a model for inclusive, citizen-centered governance.

In conclusion, the Pirate Party UK envisions a governance approach that not only promotes economic growth but also actively involves citizens, ensures transparency, and continuously evaluates policy outcomes. Our policy proposal emphasizes collaboration, information sharing, and active civic participation, all underpinned by citizen assemblies that play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our nation.
